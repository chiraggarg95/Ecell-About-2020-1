                            ‘Eureka!’ is Asia’s largest B-Model competition, as acknowledged independently by CNN and
                            Thomas Reuters. It is aimed at encouraging people to unleash their artistic potential and is
                            designed to emulate the process of the growth of an idea to a full-fledged startup, via its
                            online and offline mentoring. ‘Eureka!’ prides itself on providing a 360 degree, holistic
                            experience during the five-month period that it spans. Right from acknowledging that your
                            idea has potential, to writing a B-Model, and pitching in front of an investor, this
                            platform has it all! It provides the best entries with mentoring, consulting and excellent
                            networking opportunities in India and the Silicon Valley. Over the 14 years of its
                            existence, Eureka has grown from a competition in which 50 teams compete for prizes worth
                            INR 50,000 to a contest which sees over 8800+ entries competing for prizes worth INR 5
                            Million.
